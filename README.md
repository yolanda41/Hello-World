Hey Yolanda Here,

Just stopping by to committ on this new repository file i've created.  GitHub is something that is vefry interesting to me.  I guess the only way to understand it is to keep playing around with it.  it's been fun learning all about programming languages and how to use them.  Especially getting ready to become a FullStack Developer.  We shall see what tomorrow shall bring!
